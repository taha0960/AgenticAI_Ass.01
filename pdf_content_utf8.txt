Course: CS – 4015 Agentic AI (Section: A, B, C) 
Homework – I (Phase I) 
Scenario: Building an AI Research Assistant for University Students 
❖ Project Overview: 
Universities are overloaded with study material: lecture notes, course outlines, research 
summaries, policies and FAQs. Students often struggle to find relevant information quickly. 
You are part of a startup team building an AI Research Assistant that: 
• Searches through academic content 
• Remembers relevant information 
• Answers questions intelligently using retrieved context 
This assistant will be developed in two phases 
Phase 1 (Semantic Search Module with GUI): 
You are tasked with building the memory system of the AI Research Assistant. Before the 
agent can answer questions, it must learn how to store and retrieve knowledge semantically.  
❖ Problem Statement: Design a semantic search engine that allows the AI assistant to 
retrieve relevant academic documents based on meaning rather than keywords. 
❖ Mandatory Requirements: 
Task 1: GUI-Based Data Selection 
Using the GUI, allow the user to: 
• Upload or select a dataset (minimum 10 – 15 text documents) 
• View basic dataset information (number of documents, size) 
No dataset should be hard coded in the backend. 
Task 2: Embedding and Vector Store Configuration 
Allow the user to select: 
• Hugging Face embedding model 
• Vector database (FAISS/Chroma) 
Based on these selections: 
• Generate embeddings 
• Store embeddings in the selected vector database using LangChain 
Task 3: Semantic Retrieval 
• Provide the query input box in the GUI

• Allow the user to set top-k most relevant documents based on semantic similarity 
• Display results clearly with relevance ordering 
Task 4: Retrieval Evaluation and Analysis 
Test the system with multiple queries. Analyze the quality of retrieval results  across different 
datasets and different embedding models. 
Document the observations in the report. 
 
❖ Deliverables (Phase 1): 
1. GUI-based application 
2. Source Code 
3. Short Report (2 – 3 pages)
